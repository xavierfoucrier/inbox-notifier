Inbox Notifier is using the Cloudflare DNS resolver in order to check the internet connectivity: this allow the application to automatically reconnect to the network when the connection is lost. The Cloudflare platform will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to the resolvers. This data does not contain user IP addresses or any other personally identifiable information, and the bulk of the data is only stored for 24 hours.
